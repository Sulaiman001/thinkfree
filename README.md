NodeJS ExpressJS Express-Session EJS Mongoose Mongoodb AngularJS Bootstrap

This simple app aims to provide above techonologies integration.<br>
1. NodeJS is a trend now, so I use it as server here<br>
2. ExpressJS is the most fastest way to create a node web application, that's why I choose it<br>
3. Session is really very important for any real app, this is a must<br>
4. EJS, I choose EJS this actually because of AngularJS<br>
As most comments said, Jade is somewhat slow, especially not friendly to frontend developers. Then I was considering to use HandleBars, but it happens to use the same notation {{}} with AngularJS. Thus after serious consideration I choose EJS.<br>
5. MongooDB is great and friendly to NodeJS, no reason to use others<br>
6. Mongoose is an Object Schema for operating Mongoodb in Node, that's great<br>
7. AngularJS, it is famous for the data-binding, and that's the only feature used in this project.
I didn't use the redirection and validation, since it might be a risk for a project to use customer-side redirection.<br>
8. Bootstrap, this is a CSS framework aims to provide screen sensitive for computer, pad and mobile phones. Must have<br>

By the way, I am planning to use as less Restful services as possible in this project. It is because, restful apis is hard to manage the data security.
